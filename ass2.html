                <OL type="a">
                <Li> <U>Prepare baking pans </U></Li>
                <p>
                    No one wants a cake to stick to the pan, so it’s important to prep your pans before pouring in the batter. With the exception of angel food and chiffon cakes, most recipes call for greasing and flouring the pan or lining the pan with waxed or parchment paper.
                </p>
                <Li> <U>Allow ingredients to reach room temperature</U></Li>
                <p>
                    Many recipes require cake ingredients, such as eggs and butter, to stand at room temperature. This allows the butter to blend easily with other ingredients, and the eggs will yield a higher cake volume. (For food safety reasons, don’t leave the eggs at room temperature for more time than specified in the recipe.)
                </p>
                <Li> <U>Preheat the oven </U></Li>
                <p>
                    When a cake bakes too quickly, it can develop tunnels and cracks; too slowly, and it can be coarse. Allow your oven to preheat for at least 10 minutes, and use an oven thermometer to be sure it’s reached the proper temperature. If you’re using dark cake pans, you’ll want to reduce the oven temperature called for in your recipe by 25°F.
                </p>
                <Li> <U>Stir together dry ingredients</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    Dry ingredients usually include flour, baking powder and/or baking soda, and salt. Rather than adding each dry ingredient individually to the batter, whisk them together in a bowl beforehand. That way you’ll know the ingredients will be equally distributed throughout the batter.
                </p>
                <Li><U> Combine the butter and sugar</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    Using an electric mixer (Target) on medium to high speed, beat the butter for 30 seconds. Generally, a stand mixer requires a medium speed for this step, but a hand mixer requires a higher speed.
                </p>
                <Li> <U>add eggs one at a time</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    Add the eggs (or egg whites) one at a time, beating well after each. Their protein creates a structure around the air bubbles that will maintain the texture.
                </p>
                <Li><U> Alternate adding dry and wet ingredients</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    Alternate between adding some of the dry mixture and some of the milk (or whatever liquid is specified in your recipe) to the butter-egg-sugar mixture, beating on low speed after each addition until everything is combined. Begin and end with the flour mixture, as when liquid is mixed into flour, gluten begins to form. Too much gluten makes for a tough cake, so be sure to start and finish with the flour, and be careful not to overmix once you’ve added liquid.
                </p>
                <Li> <U>Pour batter into pans and bake</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    Divide the batter evenly between the baking pans. Use an offset spatula to spread the batter in an even layer. Be sure to spread it to the pan’s edge. Bake your cake according to your recipe’s directions.
                </p>
                <Li> <U>Check cake for doneness </U></Li>
                <p>
                    Overbaked cake equals dry cake, and no one wants that. Start checking the cake for doneness after the recipe’s stated minimum baking time, but avoid opening the oven door before then, so that the heat doesn’t escape. For creamed cakes, insert a wooden toothpick near the center of the cake. If the pick comes out clean (with only a crumb or two on it), the cake is done. If there is any wet batter on it, bake the cake for a few minutes more and test in a new spot with a new toothpick.
                </p>
                <Li><U> Cool the cake layers </U></Li>
                <p>
                    Let the cake layers cool in their pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes maximum. To remove the cakes from the pans, run a knife around the edges, which will loosen them from the sides of the pans. Place a wire rack over the top of each cake and flip the pan. Gently lift the pans off, being careful not to tear the edges of the cakes. If you used waxed or parchment paper, carefully peel the paper off the cake.
                </p>
                <Li><U> Assemble the cake</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    To avoid crumbs in your frosting, brush the cake layers with a pastry brush. Spread about a ½ cup of frosting over the first layer, then carefully top it with the next layer. Repeat until all the layers are stacked.
                </p>
                <Li><U> add the first coat of forsting</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    The secret to knowing how to frost a layer cake is a crumb coat. To do this, spread a very thin layer of frosting over the sides and top of the cake. This initial coat doesn’t need to look perfect; it’s another way to keep the crumbs out of the frosting. Let the cake stand for 30 minutes so the frosting sets up.
                </p>
                <Li><U> Frost and decorate</U> </Li>
                <p>
                    Using an offset spatula or table knife, generously spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake, swirling as you go. Once the cake is completely covered, go back and add more swirls as desired. Serve the cake within 2 hours or store in the refrigerator..

                <DT><u> CODE </u> </DT>
                <DD> In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium.
                </DD>
                <DT><u> ANALOG </u></DT>
                <DD>An analog signal is any continuous-time signal representing some other quantity, i.e., analogous to another quantity. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous signal voltage varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves.
                </DD>
                <DT><u> APPLICATION  </u></DT>
                <DD>An application, also referred to as an application program or application software, is a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application. An application can be self-contained or a group of programs. </DD>
                <DT><u> BIOS </u></DT>
                <DD> BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a computer's microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it is powered on. It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices, such as the hard disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.
                </DD>
                <DT> <U> BINARY DIGIT </U></DT>
                <DD>A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest information piece a computer can use. A bit is either a one or a zero, as these two digits make up the language computers use to process information and operate. One byte is equivalent to eight bits, and a kilobyte is equivalent to 1,024 bytes. Additional measurements include the megabyte, which is 1,024 kilobytes, and the gigabyte, which is 1,024 megabytes. </DD>
                <DT> <u> ARRAY </u></DT>
                <DD>
                    Array refers to a set of similar data that saves in a sequential form. When a computer program searches for certain information, it can pull up an array, which includes any similar data that might be useful. For example, a search for monthly social media reports can produce an array of relevant files that are organized alphabetically or numerically.
                </DD>
                <DT><u> BAND WIDTH </u></DT>
                <DD>
                    Bandwidth is the amount of information that hard-wired or wireless connections can process or transmit. An internet service provider may refer to the bandwidth when advertising its download and upload speeds. The amount of processed or transmitted information often depends on the connection format.
                </DD>
                <DT> <U> BUG </U></DT>
                <DD> 
                    A bug is an error in the programming of software or an application. These errors can cause problems for the end user. When looking for and resolving bugs, computer scientists and developers might refer to the process as fixing bugs or applying fixes.
